## 1.
Perform the following *unsigned* number base conversions:

**(a)** $$42.3_{9}$$

**(b)** $$42.3_{10}$$

**(c)** $$42.3_{8}$$

**(d)** $$1100011.11001_2$$


## 2.
Perform the following signed (2’s complement) number base conversions:

**(a)** $$1000.0100_2$$

**(b)** $$-5.1_{10}$$


## 3.
The value $$0011.0011_2$$ is the closest representation of $$+3.2_{10}$$ as a $$4.4$$ fixed-point real. What is the representational error?


## 4.
For each part, give two decimal numbers that specify the range of values that can be represented by:

**(a)** A 4-bit, unsigned binary integer

**(b)** A 4-bit, 2’s complement integer

**(c)** A signed 2.2 fixed-point real


## 5.
Assume that the variable X contains the 8-bit pattern `abcdefgh`, where each letter represents the value of the bit (either a $$0$$ or a $$1$$) in the corresponding position. E.g., if the bit pattern is $$11001010$$, then `a=1`, `b=1`, `c=0`, `d=0`, etc. Write a single line of C code to change the value of `x` to:

**(a)** `abcde0gh`

**(b)** `abcde1gh`


## 6.
What is the binary (base 2) value of each of the following expressions:

**(a)** `0xE5 | 0x7B`
**(b)** `0xE5 & 0x7B`
**(c)** `0xE5 ^ 0x7B`


## 7.
Simplify each of the following C expressions:
