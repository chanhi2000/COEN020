## 1.
Fill in the table that indicates whether or not overflow occurs during addition:

| carry-out | carry-in | unsigned overflow? | 2's complement overflow? |
| :-------: | :------: | :----------------: | :----------------------: |
| 0 | 0 | | |
| 0 | 1 | | |
| 1 | 0 | | |
| 1 | 1 | | |


## 2.
The unsigned product of the two 4-bit binary numbers $$0011$$ and $$1001$$ is $$00011011$$. Derive the 2’s complement product from this result, clearly showing the steps required.


## 3.
You can implement multiplication by the binary constant $$01011110$$ using 5 shifts and 4 additions. However, you can reduce the total number of operations if you also use subtractions. How many of each operation would be required


## 4.
Suppose you need to divide an unsigned 8-bit integer variable “X” by a constant, but there is no unsigned integer divide instruction so you decide to use reciprocal multiplication. If the 16-bit product is 0001 0001 1000 0100, then what is the __decimal__ value of the quotient?
