## 1.
When an interrupt or an exception occurs, the ARM processor pushes eight words onto the stack.

**(a)** Circle any five items from the list below that are pushed onto the stack:

#### 1(a)

| reg | reg | reg |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [x] R0 | [ ] R6 | [x] R12 |
| [x] R1 | [ ] R7 | [ ] R13 (SP) |
| [x] R2 | [ ] R8 | [x] R14 (LR) |
| [x] R3 | [ ] R9 | [ ] R15 (PC) |
| [ ] R4 | [ ] R10 | [x] Return Adrs |
| [ ] R5 | [ ] R11 | [x] xPSR (Flags) |

-----
**(b)**	Five of the eight items are pushed so that exception handlers (including interrupt service routines) can be written in C like any other function. Identify any __four__ of them.

#### 1(b)
R0, R1, R2, R3, xPSR
