## 2.
The ARM processor has three hardware features that improve exception response time (aka latency): *Tail Chaining*, *Abandoning/Suspending*, and *Late Arrival Processing*. Identify each of them below by filling in the blank with the name of the feature being described.

**(a)**	Reduces latency caused by instructions that take several clock cycles to complete.

#### 2(a)
Abandoning / Suspending

-----

**(b)**	Eliminates unnecessary stacking and un-stacking of the processor registers during back-to-back exceptions.

#### 2(b)
Tail Chaining

-----
**(c)**	Allows a high priority exception to take over an exception response initiated by a lower priority exception.

#### 2(c)
Late Arrival Processing
