## 1.
When an interrupt or an exception occurs, the ARM processor pushes eight words onto the stack.
a.	Circle any five items from the list below that are pushed onto the stack:
R0
R6
R12
R1
R7
R13 (SP)
R2
R8
R14 (LR)
R3
R9
R15 (PC)
R4
R10
Return Adrs
R5
R11
xPSR (Flags)

b.	Five of the eight items are pushed so that exception handlers (including interrupt service routines) can be written in C like any other function. Identify any four of them.
R0,	R1,	R2,	R3,	xPSR

2.	The ARM processor has three hardware features that improve exception response time (aka latency): Tail Chaining, Abandoning/Suspending, and Late Arrival Processing. Identify each of them below by filling in the blank with the name of the feature being described.
a.	Reduces latency caused by instructions that take several clock cycles to complete.
Abandoning/Suspending

b.	Eliminates unnecessary stacking and un-stacking of the processor registers during back-to-back exceptions.
Tail Chaining

c.	Allows a high priority exception to take over an exception response initiated by a lower priority exception.
Late Arrival Processing
